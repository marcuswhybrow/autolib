## Installation instruction

## 1. Install Python Dependancies

 - BeautifulSoup
 - Django 1.1.1
 - django-registration
 - django-tagging
 - simplejson

## 2. Preparing the Django Local Settings

You will need to copy the local_settings.py.tpl which specifies
the database location and other details, to do this run:

	cp local_settings.py.tpl local_settings.py

## 3. Preparing the Database

Django needs to setup the database and fill it with some initial configuration values,
to do this run:

	python manage.py syncdb
	
## 4. Running the Server

Django is now ready to go, you can now run the server by using the following command:

	python manage.py runserver

You can access the server by going to your web browser and pointing it to http://localhost:8000/

If you wish to run allow external machines to view the server also from your IP address start the
server in the following fashion instead:

	python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0

And if you wish to listen on a different port (say 80), just specify that like so:

	python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:80
